# movie-recommender-system
I have implemented a Movie Recommender system. Along with it I also have created an App.

### Libraries used
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- numpy
- pandas
- streamlit

The movie recommendation is done with <strong>Cosine Similarity</strong>.<br>
<strong>Text vectorization</strong> is performed with the help of scikit-learn library and then cosine similarity is used to find the right reommendation.

Future Scope : I will soon be deploying the app.😁😁
